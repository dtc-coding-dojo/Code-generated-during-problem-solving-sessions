### What is LaTeX
LaTex is a document preparation system which might not tell you a lot of what it actually does. What LaTex truly does is make all your texts look absolutely stunning whilst easily handling hundreds of images without ruining your whole document -looking at you microsoft word-. If that is not enough reason for you to try it out, the online platform Overleaf which we will be using here easily lets you handle version control and collaboration and provides you with an endless well of possible templates. Want you report to look like a nature publication? Just choose it as a template and change the writing and pictures and the formatting will look just like in the real thing. On top of that Overleaf also saves your document continuously and let's you access all your writings in one convenient online place from every computer in the world. This session was held as career development session on the 22nd of November 2018 and was aimed to be very practical. So instead of writing an all out report simply go to the document we provided [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jzwxzjyknjpx) and click on the Menu button in the upper left corner. From here select copy project and make it your own. Now you can easily play around in the code on the left and press control + enter to see what it does in your pdf on the right. If you are lost as to what position in the pdf corresponds to the line of code you are editing click the little arrow button between the code and the pdf. 

The explanations for the code are always directly above in comments (comments are introduced by a % sign) or written in the text itself. The document starts out with the preamble where you load all necessary packages for your document and define the type of the document. This is not very relevant for you as we have loaded most of the relevant packages for your convenience. The main part of the document begins with the \begin{document}. The basic structurin of any LaTeX document is always Chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection, subsubsubsection, etc. and will be automatically picked up by your table of contents when you edit the document. The rest is better to be experienced yourself by reading the code and the documents and playing around with it to see how the pdf changes. So go out and explore!
